**How did the students do?**

This code is written by Ali Negary as the interview task for Mosaic.
****
**A short explanation:**

I had to work for the past 2 weeks. So, I had to begin this task later. It took me a couple of hours to write the main.py and utils.py.
But the unittest (test_utils.py) took me longer than I thought it would. Because I am new to unit testing and it was the first time I did unit testing for pandas (and Honestly I don't think I did a good job).
I have tried not only the main examples (Example1 and Example2), but two other examples of my own. All were working fine.

**Why pandas?**

I benefited the vectorized calculation of Pandas to make things faster than loops. Of course I had the option to use Numpy as well.
However Pandas seemed a better choice as it had the SQL-like functionalities.

**How to Run?**

- First, you need to have a pair of running shoes :D

- Then, you need to open the terminal and enter the following command:

python [path to main.py] [path to courses.csv] [path to students.csv] [path to tests.csv] [path to marks.csv] [path to output.json]

[path to output.json] is where you like your output to be saved.

**Requirements:**

The only things you need for running the program are _sys_, _pandas_, and _json_.
